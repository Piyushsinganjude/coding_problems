## Find the Difference
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.
## Example 
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
       int sum1 = 0;
       int sum2 = 0;

       for(auto i :s)
       {
           sum1 +=i;
       }
       for(auto i :t)
       {
           sum2 +=i;
       }
       return sum2-sum1;
    }
};
 
#### Complexity
```bash
Time Complexity :O(n*n)
Space Complexity : O(1)
