## K-th element of two sorted Arrays
Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N and M respectively and an element K. The task is to find the element that would be at the kâ€™th position of the final sorted array.
 

## Example 
```bash
Input:
arr1[] = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
arr2[] = {1, 4, 8, 10}
k = 5
Output:
6
Explanation:
The final sorted array would be -
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
The 5th element of this array is 6.
```

## Solution 

```c++
class Solution{

	 public:
    Input:
arr1[] = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
arr2[] = {1, 4, 8, 10}
k = 5
Output:
6
Explanation:
The final sorted array would be -
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
The 5th element of this array is 6.
#### Complexity
```bash
Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N) + Log(M))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Log (N))
```
